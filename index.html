            <h2>Nguyen The Vinh - s3979366</h2>
            <p>My name is Nguyễn Thế Vinh, 18 years old. I’m a student at RMIT University. I’m from Hai Phong, and from a very young age I’ve had a love for video games and always wanted to develop a game myself. My hobbies are reading books and doing outside activities. I started learning code in high school to kill time. Since then I’ve developed an interest in coding. That’s when I decided to enroll in RMIT, hoping that one day I can achieve my dream of making a video game. When talking about IT, I favor a lot of things. But there are 2 areas that I am interested in most, which are web designing and game-making. During the past months since I started coding, I have gained some knowledge in several programming languages like C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and web-building languages like HTML and CSS. That’s all for my introduction.</p>

            <p>My name is Nguyen Ba Lam Quang Thai, I’m 18 years old and I’m currently living in Ha Noi with my parents. From a very young age, I had a chance to studies about technology and especially code from my big brother. Therefore, I have a stronge feeling for code particular and technology in general, and I will be follow my brother footstep some day. My hobbies are playing games and sports most like other boys in this technology field. Enrolling to RMIT is my first step in order to achieve a higher goal is to become a professional programmer or a professional cypher security guy. When talking to teachnology, I really interested in security and have a lots of question to ask the progenitor about that field. During the pass few month, I have only learn a little about security because I have to studies the foundation first before entering the challenging parts. That all of my introduction for now.</p>

            <h2>Dang Trung Kien - s3979510</h2>
            <p>My name is Dang Trung Kien. I’m 18 years old and  I am a RMIT freshman at Hanoi Campus. From a young age, my hobby is playing games because, according to some studies, games help develop intelligence quite well and it would be great if I could create my own game in the future. Although I don't seem to be very fluent in programming languages, I already know a bit about Python, Javascript, and HTML and I believe that with my efforts as well as the help of friends and teachers I will significantly improve the above weaknesses. Honestly, at first, I didn't have much experience or a great passion for IT, but the more I got into it, the more I felt it was fascinating, and helpful and will help me a lot in my future work.</p>

        <h2><strong>Group process</strong></h2>
        <p>During our time working together, we realize that teamwork is quite difficult because there are many difficulties in work as people are usually busy, and there are many assignments as well as personal work. Besides, sometimes teammates also have certain conflicts because of their personal opinions. However, after a period of working and cooperating with constant effort and solidarity, the whole group has found a common viewpoint. Everyone understood each other more deeply and knew how to divide the work effectively. As a result, the work project has been significantly enhanced.</p>
    
    <div class="career">
        <h2>Career Plan</h2>
        <p><strong>Vinh: </strong>I haven’t had a specific career plan yet because I'm still uncertain of what area of IT I want to follow. Right now, my goal is just to do my best at school, work hard and try to do as many projects as possible to equip myself with valuable experience. So that when I finally find something I want to devote myself to, I will then be more than ready for it.</p>
        <p><strong>Thai: </strong>As I mentioned above, I am really fascinated in the security field so in order to study that I have to start gaining knowledge about my future career. Moreover, I have to understand what skills are needed for the job, and pursuing a career path can take years so I have to establish smart goals to guide me throughout the process of growing. Currently, my goal is to gain as much knowledge as possible in every technology field at foundation level because I am still seeking a better opportunity.</p>
        <p><strong>Mai: </strong>I've already expressed how interested I am in AI. However, I only have a very rudimentary understanding of IT at this point due to my inadequate expertise. Because of this, even if I don't know the exact future career, I want to do one that involves artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p><strong>Kien: </strong>Currently, I do not have a specific picture of my future career. However, with my current knowledge, I hope in the future I will be able to create language-learning software.</p>
        <p><strong>Summary: </strong> In conclusion, Vinh currently has no specific career direction, he just wants to focus as best as possible to hone his knowledge. While Thai and Mai have slightly more specific paths. Thai wants to be a coder in the security industry and Mai wants to do something related to AI. The last member is Kien, he wants to be able to program an application to help learn languages more effectively in the future. In general, all 4 of us do not have a clear career direction. Since we are all newbies, all four of us simply want to focus on our studies and we're pretty sure we'll all be in IT-related positions.</p>
