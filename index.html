        <h2>Topic</h2>
        <p>Initially, our idea was to conduct research on GUI. This was our first step in the big picture. By completing our first milestone, we have gathered enough knowledge, therefore we decided to upgrade this topic one step further. Our goal is now to build a website that generates free UI for users.
            This is a difficult project that requires skills in diverse areas. Acknowledged that we only focus on building the outer face of the website, while learning and improving ourselves so that in the future time, we can give the website the functionalities that we wanted.
            </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>We are now living in a rapidly changing world. Local shopping is something that belongs to the past. A study conducted by Google has shown that 66% of shoppers prefer online shopping to find items they’re looking for, compared to 27% who prefer offline. We believe that this difference will increase in the following years. As a result, the demand for websites and applications is now surprisingly high. However, it’s not easy to make a website. U need to know how to code and have experience in User Experience. Not everyone has the time for that. Therefore, they seek solutions online. There are already multiple UI or website-making companies on the market. However, they won’t give you everything for free, there is always a limitation, most commonly known are free trials, and limits on aspects like your web bandwidth or a custom domain. That’s why this project of ours will be completely free. Not only do we provide users with solutions to their problems, but this is also a chance for us to practice and improve our skills such as coding, advertising, team working, and to boost up our Portfolio.</p>
