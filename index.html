            <h2>Nguyen The Vinh</h2>
            <p>My name is Nguyễn Thế Vinh, 18 years old. I’m a student at RMIT University. I’m from Hai Phong, and from a very young age I’ve had a love for video games and always wanted to develop a game myself. My hobbies are reading books and doing outside activities. I started learning code in high school to kill time. Since then I’ve developed an interest in coding. That’s when I decided to enroll in RMIT, hoping that one day I can achieve my dream of making a video game. When talking about IT, I favor a lot of things. But there are 2 areas that I am interested in most, which are web designing and game-making. During the past months since I started coding, I have gained some knowledge in several programming languages like C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and web-building languages like HTML and CSS. That’s all for my introduction.</p>

            <h2>Nguyen Ba Lam Quang Thai</h2>
            <p>My name is Nguyen Ba Lam Quang Thai, I’m 18 years old and I’m currently living in Ha Noi with my parents. From a very young age, I had a chance to studies about technology and especially code from my big brother. Therefore, I have a stronge feeling for code particular and technology in general, and I will be follow my brother footstep some day. My hobbies are playing games and sports most like other boys in this technology field. Enrolling to RMIT is my first step in order to achieve a higher goal is to become a professional programmer or a professional cypher security guy. When talking to teachnology, I really interested in security and have a lots of question to ask the progenitor about that field. During the pass few month, I have only learn a little about security because I have to studies the foundation first before entering the challenging parts. That all of my introduction for now.</p>

            <h2>Dang Trung Kien</h2>
            <p>My name is Dang Trung Kien. I’m 18 years old and  I am a RMIT freshman at Hanoi Campus. From a young age, my hobby is playing games because, according to some studies, games help develop intelligence quite well and it would be great if I could create my own game in the future. Although I don't seem to be very fluent in programming languages, I already know a bit about Python, Javascript, and HTML and I believe that with my efforts as well as the help of friends and teachers I will significantly improve the above weaknesses. Honestly, at first, I didn't have much experience or a great passion for IT, but the more I got into it, the more I felt it was fascinating, and helpful and will help me a lot in my future work.</p>
