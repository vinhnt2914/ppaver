        <div class="topic">
            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>Initially, our idea was to conduct research on GUI. This was our first step in the big picture. By completing our first milestone, we have gathered enough knowledge, therefore we decided to upgrade this topic one step further. Our goal is now to build a website that generates free UI for users.
            This is a difficult project that requires skills in diverse areas. Acknowledged that we only focus on building the outer face of the website, while learning and improving ourselves so that in the future time, we can give the website the functionalities that we wanted.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>We are now living in a rapidly changing world. Local shopping is something that belongs to the past. A study conducted by Google has shown that 66% of shoppers prefer online shopping to find items they’re looking for, compared to 27% who prefer offline. We believe that this difference will increase in the following years. As a result, the demand for websites and applications is now surprisingly high. However, it’s not easy to make a website. U need to know how to code and have experience in User Experience. Not everyone has the time for that. Therefore, they seek solutions online. There are already multiple UI or website-making companies on the market. However, they won’t give you everything for free, there is always a limitation, most commonly known are free trials, and limits on aspects like your web bandwidth or a custom domain. That’s why this project of ours will be completely free. Not only do we provide users with solutions to their problems, but this is also a chance for us to practice and improve our skills such as coding, advertising, team working, and to boost up our Portfolio.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="roles-content">
            <p>From our perspective, defining roles for particular participants is crucially important, which helps the project take less time to be done, and improves the productivity of the group project. Moreover, each role is critical to the overall success and operations of the group project, better time management, and identifies areas of weakness that eliminate all unhealthy competition or conflicts between members. Before defining roles and responsibilities, we first need to clearly understand each member's characteristics. After considering it, we decided to choose Vinh as the leader and the Main Developer because he has a profound understanding of coding and every member’s strengths and weaknesses and will organize and guide the team by making decisions that will benefit the project. Continue with Thai as our Graphic User Design who designed our website that looks better to the users, he always enhances the communication between members when struggling or having some personal problem, and provides recommendations. Another person is Thanh Mai, who works as a secretary and constantly notes down important information and issues that our group is struggling with and brings up a solution. She also keeps checking the work, making sure everything is on track. Last but not least, Kien takes on the research part, collects, reports, and analyzes the data, and provides critical information that is needed for the project. Besides, he is willing to support any members that are struggling with their part and make sure the project follows the requirements and standards. Our group does not change roles throughout the working period because changing roles will interrupt the process which takes more time and effort, create more broken parts and make it more complicated. Therefore, we will do the best we can based on each individual’s strengths with the spirit of mutual support.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>When working as a group, there are still some hurdles engendering self-deprecating and dissenting points of view.</li>
                <p>Solutions: Sometimes, our members have different viewpoints, so we have to group up to listen and consider every opinion carefully, one by one. As a result, everyone can hear others' opinions and choose the best one.</p>
                <li>When the project is gradually being completed, some team members started to think they do too much work while others did little than them. Therefore, little thought leads to conflict in the team.</li>
                <p>Solutions: We believe that the only solution to this problem is we have to make it clear who's going to do what and take responsibility in each section before starting this project. Moreover, if anyone has completed their section, they can also support other teammates if they want.</p>
                <li>Lack of liability: sometimes some individuals forget their assigned tasks because of their personal work.</li>
                <p>Solutions: Instead of reprimanding creating a tense atmosphere, remind the member tactfully. Let them know that because of their lack of accountability, the overall results of the group are significantly affected.</p>
                <li>Miss communication: Throughout the working process, some members will do their part alone without the approval of others. Therefore, the project will not be completed and the parts of the article will not connect with each other, which kills productivity. Moreover, miss communication can also lead to conflict and misunderstanding in the team.</li>
                <p>Solutions: This problem will easily be fixed with every person's responsibility, and always take time to understand what their teammates were saying, do not assume personal perception on anyone writing. In addition, encourage members to hand out the solution or suggest the part where there are problems or mistakes.</p>

                    <li><div class="bold">Drag and drop website builder:</div>Our project will have the function to generate free website templates or UI for any application that users desire. For the website, users have 2 options. The first one is choosing a pre-made template and customizing it or starting with a blank one if they wanted to. The second option is to learn how to create that template from scratch. Not all templates will have this option, only some specific ones. Not only that, users can publish their templates to the community for free or with earnings. Earning will be given based on our judgment.</li>
                    <li><div class="bold">eCommerce functionality:</div> Here, you may use AI business tools to run and expand your professional eCommerce firm. Users may begin creating their eCommerce website for free by selecting one of several expertly created website templates that best suit their needs as a business. Once your brand's website platform is up and running, you can add your items using the store builder to make product listings for your eCommerce site and generate a personalized company email address. After that, fine-tune the AI engine (make a professional logo, a catchy company name, or modify the layout of your online store to boost sales with AI business tools), and you're good to go.</li>
                    <li><div class="bold">Domains and hosting:</div> An IP address is a unique set of integers used to identify websites. However, a domain name will transform that IP address into a more recognizable one that can also be typed into a web browser's address bar. As an illustration, our domain name may be guiproject.com. A top-level domain, or TLD, is a domain ending in ".com". URLs and domains are not the same thing. a website's unique URL that points to a particular page or section, like guiproject.com/en/domain. Typically, businesses select their domain name based on their brand. Of course, you are under no obligation to. However, since you'll most likely need to include the domain name in your business email address, it makes sense for it to coincide with or be very similar to the domain name. 
                        People have the option of selecting the same Website, Online Store, or Advanced Store package and get a second domain name for free for the first year. Additionally, registering a domain name cheaply is just the start. Obtain reasonable renewal costs and spend your money on expansion rather than merely upkeep. Our websites are all hosted free of charge and indefinitely. Put your faith in the most dependable web hosting service now offered and forget about considering paying more for web hosting. You may create a website or an online store in addition to registering and purchasing a domain name. All extremely simple.

This will provide the community with a wide range of templates to choose from. Along with that, users will be equipped with website-making skills if they choose our second option. They can also make some income if they are talented in website building by sending us their templates.</p>
                <h2>Limitations: </h2> <p>Right now our website is only limited to web designing, we can not provide users with free web hosting or a custom domain yet. This will be developed in the future when we have enough expenses.</p>
                <h2>Improvements: </h2> <p>The website is in a very early stage, we have only done with its appearance. More pre-made templates will be created by us soon in the future. In the long run, we will focus on bug fixing to provide users with the best experience and work on the web hosting service.</p>
