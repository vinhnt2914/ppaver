            <p>Whether a business is a large company, a startup, or a tiny nonprofit, project managers keep everything going smoothly. While a project manager, it is my responsibility to oversee procedures and keep things moving forward as I collaborate with numerous stakeholders both inside and occasionally outside of my firm. I'm not everyone's boss, though. In order to inspire others to take action even when they don't report to you, I must be able to assume a leadership position without a formal leadership title and build and manage connections. “The project managers, the really good ones, were really awesome with people. They connected on a different level. There wasn’t weird tension; it was really a collaboration", According to Muse career counselor Alina Campos, who has also worked as a project manager and managed a team of project managers as well as recruited project managers, there was no strange tension at all. With such a leadership mindset, I believe I will do well in managing a project. 
                <br>For managing a team of 4 people developing a website that generates GUI automatically for users, the following positions are needed:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Web developer: Site planning, design, creation, and upgrading are the main goals of development activities. These jobs frequently call for substantial technical and design expertise:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Website planning: To comprehend the objectives for a website, developers collaborate with clients or employers. The developer is in charge of creating a completion schedule for the site once she is aware of these objectives.</li>
                        <li>Website architecture: Information is frequently found in abundance on websites. However, if the website is not well organized, it may be challenging to get this information. A website's structure is created by a developer to make it simple for visitors to find information and other services.</li>
                        <li>Website design: A website should be appealing and simple to read and use. To choose color schemes, images, and fonts that make a site simple to use, developers collaborate with visual designers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>Web Tester and Cyber Security: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Security concerns: Website owners continue to be very concerned about security. This is especially true if the website is used to sell goods, collect payments, or handle private data like names and addresses. To build safe websites, developers can employ best practice guidelines and security tools.</li>
                        <li>Testing: To ensure that their websites function properly, developers test them. When attempting to use many software programs and design components, this procedure might be challenging.</li>
                        <li>Technical problem-solving: Developers could be asked to address technical issues. While most minor difficulties may be resolved by site administrators or webmasters, a developer's participation may be required in the event of a serious malfunction, incompatibility, or hacker assault.</li>
                        <li>Redesigning websites: A lot of organizations and companies frequently update and, in some cases, completely redesign their websites. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as the necessity to update a website's look and feel, the incorporation of new programming languages and apps, or because a business rebranding calls for a big aesthetic change. During the redesign, a web developer makes sure the site is as functional as feasible.</li>
                    </ul>  
                </li>
                <li>Content manager:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Updates and content strategy: A website's performance depends heavily on its content. Administrators have the option of producing material themselves or hiring freelancers to do so, including textual text, images, audio, and video. Some businesses employ a content manager to supervise the gathering and updating of information.</li>
                        <li>Promotion of the website: A website administrator may be in charge of advertising a website using a variety of media, such as banner adverts, social media, and link exchanges with other websites.</li>
                        <li>Advertising and affiliate marketing tactics: Affiliate marketing and third-party advertising are common ways for websites to make money. To create successful plans for monetizing a site, administrators may collaborate with external advertisers or affiliate networks.</li>
                        <li>Site analytics: Webmasters frequently examine site analytics to gauge a site's effectiveness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>            
            </ol>
            <p>Certification:
                <ul>
                    <li>Building cutting-edge websites and online solutions for at least three years</li>
                    <li>Website portfolio or references to pertinent finished projects</li>
                    <li>Competent in PHP</li>
                    <li>Strong oral and written English communication skills</li>
                    <li>Excellent organizational abilities and attention to detail are essential</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>There are other talents and personality traits that, like any career, can support a person's success in this line of work. These consist of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Thorough understanding of programming languages and development software: While coursework in programming languages and software programs is beneficial, it is imperative that a developer gain proficiency with these tools by using them regularly.</li>
                    <li>Willingness to follow design trends: Consumers may be fickle, therefore many clients will want to retain the aesthetic attractiveness of their websites. Front-end developers must be imaginative people who can convey concepts and brands graphically.</li>
                    <li> Understanding of web content management, search engine optimization (SEO), and web copywriting: Developers who wish to transition into project management must learn about web content in order to properly manage editors and copywriters.</li>
                    <li>Understanding of social media: Many Internet users have social media profiles. Websites and content should be social media sharing-optimized. Additionally, a lot of websites now include social network feeds.</li>
                    <li>Listening skills: Many clients and employers have a stake in the success of the site. This is due to the website serving as an online representation of a person or corporate entity. People form an opinion of a website's owner or sponsor after visiting it. In order to build a successful website, front-end developers must be able to listen to clients or project managers. Front-end developers are in charge of what website visitors view and interact with on a site.</li>
                    <li> Outstanding ability to operate in a team: Front-end developers frequently collaborate with project managers, copywriters, back-end developers, and graphic designers. Additionally, another team from a company's marketing department can be giving this team instructions. The creation of high-quality sites requires the ability to work well with others. According to an O*Net Online poll by the U.S. Department of Labor, 67% of developers had face-to-face interactions with clients and coworkers every day.</li>
                    <li>Effective time management: A front-end engineer has to be well-versed in time management in order to provide work to customers and employers on schedule. Because there are so many individuals working on a single project, it is essential that each team member be able to accept accountability for delivering deliverables on time. Additionally, a developer must be adaptable enough to change timelines when delays occur.</li>
                </ul>
