                <h2>Functionalities</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><div class="bold">Drag and drop website builder:</div>Our project will have the function to generate free website templates or UI for any application that users desire. For the website, users have 2 options. The first one is choosing a pre-made template and customizing it or starting with a blank one if they wanted to. The second option is to learn how to create that template from scratch. Not all templates will have this option, only some specific ones. Not only that, users can publish their templates to the community for free or with earnings. Earning will be given based on our judgment.</li>
                    <li><div class="bold">eCommerce functionality:</div> Here, you may use AI business tools to run and expand your professional eCommerce firm. Users may begin creating their eCommerce website for free by selecting one of several expertly created website templates that best suit their needs as a business. Once your brand's website platform is up and running, you can add your items using the store builder to make product listings for your eCommerce site and generate a personalized company email address. After that, fine-tune the AI engine (make a professional logo, a catchy company name, or modify the layout of your online store to boost sales with AI business tools), and you're good to go.</li>
                    <li><div class="bold">Currency:</div> This is a very unique function that we think will attract lots of users. Our currency will be named U-Coins, these can be used for various purposes like buying special components, effects, or templates. This function will help our users feel more entertained when using our website, and hopefully encourage them to use our service more.</li>
                    <li><div class="bold">Domains and hosting:</div> An IP address is a unique set of integers used to identify websites. However, a domain name will transform that IP address into a more recognizable one that can also be typed into a web browser's address bar. As an illustration, our domain name may be guiproject.com. A top-level domain, or TLD, is a domain ending in ".com". URLs and domains are not the same thing. a website's unique URL that points to a particular page or section, like guiproject.com/en/domain. Typically, businesses select their domain name based on their brand. Of course, you are under no obligation to. However, since you'll most likely need to include the domain name in your business email address, it makes sense for it to coincide with or be very similar to the domain name. 
                        People have the option of selecting the same Website, Online Store, or Advanced Store package and get a second domain name for free for the first year. Additionally, registering a domain name cheaply is just the start. Obtain reasonable renewal costs and spend your money on expansion rather than merely upkeep. Our websites are all hosted free of charge and indefinitely. Put your faith in the most dependable web hosting service now offered and forget about considering paying more for web hosting. You may create a website or an online store in addition to registering and purchasing a domain name. All extremely simple.
                        </li>
                    <li><div class="bold">Service and security:</div> You may get in touch with our committed customer success team if you experience any problems with any area of your website. Additionally, your website is secured with HTTPS encryption to guarantee the privacy of your visitors, the safety of your website, and the ranking of your website by search engines. Last but not least, the highest rated transaction security is used to secure all online transactions on online retailers.</li>
                    <li><div class="bold">AI business tools:</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We assist you in quickly producing original, inventive, and search-engine-friendly content. You may rapidly generate text for you with our AI writer.</li>
                            <li>With the aid of our blog title generator, you can come up with creative blog posts that will engage readers.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>             
                </ol>
                <h2>How it work: </h2> <p>The website concept will be drag and drop. Basically, each item will be embedded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. By dragging items onto the workspace, our system will automatically add those codes into the code space. After finishing the website, users can copy the code for their use. The real-time tutoring is limited to a few templates only, so they are pre-made. The “Make money from your template” function is very simple, after users click on the share button, the template (code included) will be public across our website, and will also be sent to us to evaluate. If all requirements are matched, we will send them an email informing them that their templates are qualified and ask whether they wanted to put a price on their template or not. They will be selling their work for our currency, they can choose whether to buy other components, effects and templates using the U-Coins or withdraw to real money. If choose to withdraw, we will pay them through PayPal. For the web-hosting function, we are planning to find a trustworthy hosting provider to host our website and our customer's sites too. For our security, we will only choose web host providers that offer HTTPS, if not we will request an SSL/TLS certificate from Certificate Authorities and install by ourselves. Last but not least is our AI tools. This is a very challenging one, due to lacks of time and knowledge, we are currently still in research. We are trying our best to figure out how this type of AI work in similar websites, so that we can apply the same concept.</p>
                <h2>The benefits: </h2>
                <p>For our website: As stated earlier, most of these templates are totally free, except for some published by other users. This will provide the community with a wide range of templates to choose from. Along with that, users will be equipped with website-making skills if they choose our second option. They can also make some income if they are talented in website building by sending us their templates.</p>
                <h2>Limitations: </h2> <p>Right now our website is only limited to web designing, we can not provide users with free web hosting or a custom domain yet. This will be developed in the future when we are well-experienced enough.</p>
                <h2>Improvements: </h2> <p>The website is in a very early stage, we have only done with its appearance. More pre-made templates will be created by us soon in the future. In the long run, we will focus on bug fixing to provide users with the best experience and work on the web hosting service.</p>
