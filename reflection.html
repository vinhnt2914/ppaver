        <h2>Nguyen The Vinh</h2>
        <p>In this Final Assignment, my job was to take care of different parts of the report and contribute to the group website. Most of my work is done, our group website structure is completed, and the writing is at 90%. Everything went fine for me, however, there were some problems with the text effect on our group website 3 days before the deadline. But we managed to fix it. Other than that, our report went well, even though we started a bit late compared to other groups, we got the hang of it. There were indeed some difficult moments, but all were under control.
            Aside from that, I still think that our group website could be improved a little bit. Since there was no linking button, the page was very long making it somewhat unprofessional. If we had more time and practice, we could have made that improvement. But still, it was very surprising how we were able to make a good-looking website in just about 4 days even though we were all new to web-building. Working with Group40 taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of understanding the lecturer and always coming up with a well-organized plan.

        <p>From my perspective, I think that the thing that went well in my group is communication because every member always expresses their problems, and what they struggling with and reached out for more help. Therefore, we increased our productivity, and working in a group is easier than ever. There is the only thing that should be improved is the research skill of my team because it took us a lot of time to get to the information we looking for that was related to the topic. In addition, research skill is one of the most vital skills so we have to enhance it significantly. The thing that surprise me the most is all the skills that my members had, they work effectively and actively, and perfect for them to play their own roles. Their skills are suitable for their work and sometimes it even supports others to make the project better. At the end of the project, what matters the most is what I have learned from our group work experience. During the period of working together, unexpected situations happen all the time which force me to make a decision and handle the pressure and exception.</p>

        <p>When the group project was finally completed, I felt quite relieved that everyone in the group did their part quite well. And from my viewpoint, the results are also relatively good. However, since this is the first semester, most people take a lot of time to get to know each other as well as reveal all their abilities, so some places in the working process are not completely optimized. I hope that in the future I will personally improve my work efficiency as well as arrange a reasonable schedule to have more free time to help other teammates. Honestly, I was surprised at the talent of the individuals on the team as well as the extremely useful knowledge I received about IT during the time the team worked on the project together. Through the last project, I learned a lot about how to divide work and solve assignments together. I feel absolutely elated at the result and undoubtedly this final project assignment has left me with a lot of memories and memorable experiences.</p>

        <p>For me, this project is quite difficult since, in every part of the project, we had to go into the details and figure out what our product needed to be able to create something groundbreaking. I was a bit overwhelmed at the beginning of the project, however, in each meeting, my teammates explained to me the parts that I found difficult and we supported each other every step of the way to complete the project. After completing the project, I found that the hardest part was making the web. I feel that if my knowledge of web making was good, this project could have been easier. Even so, it is really impressive that my team completed the report and the web within 5 days, although there is still a lot of editing, everything was finished and completed earlier than expected 3 days. I learned a lot through this experience, it's not only knowledge but also how to work in a team. Everyone on the team is very united and always on time, they give me a comfortable but disciplined working environment, thereby completing the project on schedule and exactly what we expected when we started the project.</p>
