            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>Initially, our idea was to conduct research on GUI. This was our first step in the big picture. By completing our first milestone, we have gathered enough knowledge, therefore we decided to upgrade this topic one step further. Our goal is now to build a website that generates free UI for users.
            This is a difficult project that requires skills in diverse areas. Acknowledged that we only focus on building the outer face of the website, while learning and improving ourselves so that in the future time, we can give the website the functionalities that we wanted.
            </p>

        <div class="motivation">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>We are now living in a rapidly changing world. Local shopping is something that belongs to the past. A study conducted by Google has shown that 66% of shoppers prefer online shopping to find items they’re looking for, compared to 27% who prefer offline. We believe that this difference will increase in the following years. As a result, the demand for websites and applications is now surprisingly high. However, it’s not easy to make a website. U need to know how to code and have experience in User Experience. Not everyone has the time for that. Therefore, they seek solutions online. There are already multiple UI or website-making companies on the market. However, they won’t give you everything for free, there is always a limitation, most commonly known are free trials, and limits on aspects like your web bandwidth or a custom domain. That’s why this project of ours will be completely free. Not only do we provide users with solutions to their problems, but this is also a chance for us to practice and improve our skills such as coding, advertising, team working, and to boost up our Portfolio.</p> 
        </div>
        <div class="landscape">
            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>In the market right now, there are already many products like us. UI-generating website isn’t something new, it has been there for a long time like Wix, Webflow, Weebly, and GoDaddy, just to name a few. However, they don’t give u everything for free. There is always some limitations to what u can do using their service. Usually, they ended up with asking u to pay. Acknowledging that problem, we made our website completely free. Users can have access to all of our functions without having to pay a single cent. This will make sure they have the best experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="aims-content">
            <p>As you can see in the Topic, our group is building a website, which generates UI for users completely free. UI design plays an important role in our daily life and also in the success of a website or an application, which is a challenging process. It maximizes a website or app's responsiveness, effectiveness, and accessibility rather than just concentrating on its appearance. When users design UI by themselves, it is vital for us to always keep the user experience and user expectations from our website in their mind. The big picture of this website is to support users as a tool, not a replacement. Besides, our website is to teach the user something from us so they can understand and utilize our service better. 
                In order to bring the best experience to the user, we have several goals that need to be achieved to fulfill the big picture. The first thing that comes to our mind is the feedback section, which is a vital function that every website or application has to have. Both positive and negative feedback is crucial because it keeps us going, and shows us what needs to be improved in order to reach a higher level. The second thing is the search bar because it is not always easy for the user to find what they are looking for quickly. Moreover, the search bar will help the user navigate around and we do not want to force them to figure out what category the function they are looking for belongs to. The search bar is also another way to display content to the user that they would not have reached on their own. Last but not least, is the “About us” section, which is an excellent and professional way to do our own storytelling. We use this section to express our emotions, feelings, stories, and uniqueness in order to build a sense of trust or gain loyalty from the customer. 
                </p>
            <p>If things do not go as we expected, we will go for the feedback section after the core of the website. The feedback is fast and easy to put on the website, which is crucial for us to get the response of the user. If we have enough time and resources to finish one of our goals, we would choose the “About us” section. The “About us” section is about the same as our reputation, uniqueness, and telling our journey, it also maybe turns the potential user into our client.</p>

            <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="plans-content">
            <p>Our project began in week 1 when we assembled our team. Shortly after, during that day, we have an online meeting to decide on our roles and assign some work to do in the last few days of the week. Vinh is the Leader, Thai is the Designer, Mai is the Secretary, and Kien takes up his role as the supporter. We also discover each other's likes and dislikes, our IT knowledge and skills, and some information about our backgrounds. It was a long talk but fruitful. We get to know each other better and can decide on the topic area for our project. It was Facebook since we all use social media a lot, and Facebook is also one of the biggest social media platforms. We then spend the weekends researching more about Facebook to have a precise idea of what our topic should be. At the start of week 2, we did another online meeting, we then finalized our topic, which was “Research about 9 most popular features of Facebook”. Afterward, we divided the work among our team, everyone was responsible for at least 2 features. During that week, we did our studying and summarized everything in our team’s Google Docs. We also had several short meetings both online and offline to check up on everyone's progress. Everything was going perfectly fine, and all the deadlines were done on time. At the end of the week, we submit our work for Early Feedback. We received our feedback in week 3, it wasn’t as good as we expected, but we weren’t discouraged. In the following days, we worked really hard to meet the expectations of the feedback. However, there is a part that really got us struggling, we couldn’t find any information on the Internet, and for the first time ever, we wanted to give up. Later on that day, we had another online meeting. We were all clear that the topic needed to be changed, so we worked on finding some commons in our interests again. Luckily, it didn’t take too long this time, we finally had our new topic, which was “Research about GUI '' hoping that we won’t make the same mistake this time. At that time, it was the end of Week 3, but fortunately, the deadline was rescheduled 1 week later so we had time to do our new project. Our plan was the same: do research, summarize ideas in Google Docs and participate in group meetings. But it was at a much faster pace because there was lots of stuff to do in a very limited time. It was a hard time for us, we were all exhausted but we managed to accomplish it in time. But what we received back was nowhere near our expectation, we got 5/10, and everyone was so disappointed. Looking on the bright side, we learned a valuable lesson for us. We failed because we didn’t fully understand what the assignment was. In the “Scope” section, you are supposed to give out the limits of what you can do and what your project will have, but we misunderstood that and actually did our research in that section. We learned a valuable lesson of reading everything carefully, listening to the lecturer and asking questions if you are not sure.  After the first project, we didn’t start our final project right away because the deadline is in January and we have other courses to finish too. So we took a break from the IT project and focused on finishing other deadlines. It was a 3-week period, during that time we also gained some pretty useful skills while doing other assignments. In this last project, we wanted to take advantage of our previous topic, which is “Research about GUI''. This is now the start of week 8, we had a quick meeting later that day, trying to figure out what’s everyone's favorite aspect of GUI. It was really lucky how we shared the interest, we all liked the fact that UI makes everything look more aesthetic, easier to use, plus we were also interested in websites and the lecture at that time was about HTML, CSS. It was an great opportunity for us, we agreed that the idea will be making a UI generating and designing website. Basically, whoever uses our website can design their own web using the popular drag & drop function or customize premade templates. We also support building UI for applications or games. The idea here is that we want to follow the path the other website builder site has paved, but also making it unique. We recognized that 90% of web-building pages aren’t free, they always have some way to make you pay, like limiting what you can do. We know our website will definitely won’t be able to compare with other competitors, that’s why we choose to make everything free. This was a very big step for us from just doing research on GUI to building a UI-generating website, but firstly we need to make a completed draft of our website first. We spend the next few days, testing out other competitors to have a better experience what the web-builder market right now and take some inspirations from them. After, we done another online meeting to finalize on what functions will our website has. The most important is drag & drop, because that’s how users can design their UI. We know that other web-builder site always have some templates for use, so we wanted to design our own too, they will be unique, made by us. We also wanted to host the web and give custom domains to users. Last but not least, security is vital too, no one will want to use our service know they are risking their private information. That was the idea, however we didn’t started right away because we wanted to focus on the report. It was definitely much longer than the previous one and this time we have to make our group website too, that’s double the work. It was quite late now, so we did a quick job delegate. Thai and Vinh were the only 2 members that knew web-making so they were responsible for the website. Kien and Mai is assigned to write the report. Our report was going quite smoothly, but the website wasn’t. We know some basics of building a website, but our design thinking were very immature and we lack advanced knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So we had to study and practice a lot before actually working on the web itself. The hard work paid off, the website run smoothly after we published on Github. But we weren’t satisfied, we wanted to add some text effect to it. It was risky, cause the effect might crash or interrupt other parts of the website and we might not be able to fix it, but we were ready to take on a challenge. So we do more study from Youtube and get our hands on adding some effects. The risks that we mentioned did happen but luckily we were able to control them. The website was finally done, we leave it there for a few days, and change our focus to the report. It was almost finished by that time, however we double check the requirements and guides on Canvas to make sure the same mistake won’t happen again. And it was a right decision, we notice that, some sections aren’t correct. This time we have more than enough time to adjust them. All of our expectations were met, some were even before the deadlines that we’ve setted. It was time to move the attention to our big idea. It was week 11 when we started building the website. Acknowledged that we don’t have much time left, plus we have to deal with other assignments and tests too, we were only able to design the outlook of the website. Initially, our aims was to design both the look of our site and some pre-made templates for users. At that time we was quite confident about our web-building skill, but in reality things were much harder, so we couldn’t stick with our goal. It was quite disappointing that we couldn’t have done more, but we are grateful for what we have. This is a project that we really want to continue developing, as it will be good practice for us to train our coding, artistic thinking and teamwork skills, serve as foundation for future project. After this course end, we will be focusing on completing the web-designing function to put this idea into practice as soon as possible, and hopefully, we can soon finish the web hosting and security service too.</p>

            <h2>Roles</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="roles-content">
            <p>From our perspective, defining roles for particular participants is crucially important, which helps the project take less time to be done, and improves the productivity of the group project. Moreover, each role is critical to the overall success and operations of the group project, better time management, and identifies areas of weakness that eliminate all unhealthy competition or conflicts between members. Before defining roles and responsibilities, we first need to clearly understand each member's characteristics. After considering it, we decided to choose Vinh as the leader and the Main Developer because he has a profound understanding of coding and every member’s strengths and weaknesses and will organize and guide the team by making decisions that will benefit the project. Continue with Thai as our Graphic User Design who designed our website that looks better to the users, he always enhances the communication between members when struggling or having some personal problem, and provides recommendations. Another person is Thanh Mai, who works as a secretary and constantly notes down important information and issues that our group is struggling with and brings up a solution. She also keeps checking the work, making sure everything is on track. Last but not least, Kien takes on the research part, collects, reports, and analyzes the data, and provides critical information that is needed for the project. Besides, he is willing to support any members that are struggling with their part and make sure the project follows the requirements and standards. Our group does not change roles throughout the working period because changing roles will interrupt the process which takes more time and effort, create more broken parts and make it more complicated. Therefore, we will do the best we can based on each individual’s strengths with the spirit of mutual support.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="scopes-content">
            <p>We have made the decision to create a UI generator and designer website based on the knowledge we have gathered after our research about GUI. Users can develop UI for their web or applications using drag and drop or pre-made templates. Users may develop websites for sales, commerce, and marketing in addition to conventional websites. Most worthwhile projects are "endless", in that there is always more that you can do, more features to be added, more levels to be designed, or new devices that could be used. 
                As mentioned above, our website also suffers from development limitations. Our intention is to create a website with all the features mentioned in the “Project Outcomes” section. However, those features have not been put into operation yet, due to limited understanding of artificial intelligence, creativity in GUI programming, and lack of time. Therefore, our current website only has an external interface. What we now do can only provide you with information on the features and aesthetics of the site. In the future, we will complete the website with full usable features and make sure they work well by adding the necessary knowledge when developing a website, having a clear plan and timetable, understanding the goals, reasonable division of work, and checking the site after work.

            <p>For the website, we use the Figma application to design our website look. Then we write the code for it using Visual Studio. Pre-build content with embedded code and pre-made templates will also be done using Visual Studio. Currently, this is what we are aiming for, we haven’t decided on the tools and technology for other content yet, we wanted to focus on building the structure of the website first because right now it’s the only thing we can achieve. They will be done in the future when we have gathered enough knowledge and experience.</p>

After using the product, they will be asked to fill out a form to answer the following questions:
                    <ol type="I">
                        <li>Is the website easy to use and convenient?</li>

            </ol>
            <p>After receiving feedback from users, we will change and improve the website. Once the site is at its most complete, we'll put it in beta. With the first 20 people using the site, they will be asked to test and give feedback, these users will receive a website with the full domain name as a thank you for their contributions.</p>
            <p>
                Once all the above steps have been completed, we will finalize the website and put it live. Of course, in the future when the website has been put into operation, we will still receive feedback from users and continuously update the website to become the most complete.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>3rd Party Systems conflicted or error: When we working on our project, we combine the 3rd Party systems with our work sometimes it made conflict or error. Moreover, some small mistakes like that could interrupt our working process and take more time and effort to fix.</li>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> We research all the 3rd Systems that are suitable to our work, the requirement must be fully identified and the resources must be clear, precious, and updated or tested every day because when we use that app, we also learn new things so we need to have a clear understanding about that 3rd Party. Moreover, it is very important for the overall project's success.</p>
                <li>Software is difficult to learn: When working on our project, we choose Visual Studio as our coding platform, along with learning. There is a lot going on in the GUI of Visual Studio and the probability of us not understanding what this icon or button does is very likely to happen. Interfere with something we don’t understand might severely interrupt our work. The worst thing that could happen is we accidentally delete everything.</li>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Before working with Visual Studio or any coding platform, we must read their documentation first and watch videos about how to use them. If we came across any function that we don’t understand, we must not use it until we do.</p>
                <li>Server crash: When making and hosting a website we also have to face the risk of crashing. That risk can be from multiple sources. It could be from our host provider experiencing trouble, or our domain has expired if we happen to buy one. If not, then the problems could be from us, maybe when we add more features, our code is broken or some plugins have errors. The worst of all is malicious attacks, one of the most common is DDos</li>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> When hosting our web, we need to look for a credible host provider, especially if they offer web protection. When adding plugins or extra codes, we must double-check and test-run it first.</p>

                    <li>Any ideas or feedback will be sent through the chat section in Teams ( or through the current website/app that we work on, if possible) and delivered directly face-to-face during the meet-up. We are expected to have at least 6 hours of communication both offline and online per week.</li>
