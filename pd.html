            <h2>Topic</h2>
            <p>Initially, our idea was to conduct research on GUI. This was our first step in the big picture. By completing our first milestone, we have gathered enough knowledge, therefore we decided to upgrade this topic one step further. Our goal is now to build a website that generates free UI for users.
            This is a difficult project that requires skills in diverse areas. Acknowledged that we only focus on building the outer face of the website, while learning and improving ourselves so that in the future time, we can give the website the functionalities that we wanted.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>We are now living in a rapidly changing world. Local shopping is something that belongs to the past. A study conducted by Google has shown that 66% of shoppers prefer online shopping to find items they’re looking for, compared to 27% who prefer offline. We believe that this difference will increase in the following years. As a result, the demand for websites and applications is now surprisingly high. However, it’s not easy to make a website. U need to know how to code and have experience in User Experience. Not everyone has the time for that. Therefore, they seek solutions online. There are already multiple UI or website-making companies on the market. However, they won’t give you everything for free, there is always a limitation, most commonly known are free trials, and limits on aspects like your web bandwidth or a custom domain. That’s why this project of ours will be completely free. Not only do we provide users with solutions to their problems, but this is also a chance for us to practice and improve our skills such as coding, advertising, team working, and to boost up our Portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>In the market right now, there are already many products like us. UI-generating website isn’t something new, it has been there for a long time like Wix, Webflow, Weebly, and GoDaddy, just to name a few. However, they don’t give u everything for free. There is always some limitations to what u can do using their service. Usually, they ended up with asking u to pay. Acknowledging that problem, we made our website completely free. Users can have access to all of our functions without having to pay a single cent. This will make sure they have the best experience.</p>

                "I think the answer is 'no way' for a third party to win the presidency, but they could potentially pick off the House and maybe the Senate," said Barrows. "I don't think a third party is viable this time, but there should be a serious effort to get candidates in place.</p>

        <div class="roles-content">
            <p>From our perspective, defining roles for particular participants is crucially important, which helps the project take less time to be done, and improves the productivity of the group project. Moreover, each role is critical to the overall success and operations of the group project, better time management, and identifies areas of weakness that eliminate all unhealthy competition or conflicts between members. Before defining roles and responsibilities, we first need to clearly understand each member's characteristics. After considering it, we decided to choose Vinh as the leader and the Main Developer because he has a profound understanding of coding and every member’s strengths and weaknesses and will organize and guide the team by making decisions that will benefit the project. Continue with Thai as our Graphic User Design who designed our website that looks better to the users, he always enhances the communication between members when struggling or having some personal problem, and provides recommendations. Another person is Thanh Mai, who works as a secretary and constantly notes down important information and issues that our group is struggling with and brings up a solution. She also keeps checking the work, making sure everything is on track. Last but not least, Kien takes on the research part, collects, reports, and analyzes the data, and provides critical information that is needed for the project. Besides, he is willing to support any members that are struggling with their part and make sure the project follows the requirements and standards. Our group does not change roles throughout the working period because changing roles will interrupt the process which takes more time and effort, create more broken parts and make it more complicated. Therefore, we will do the best we can based on each individual’s strengths with the spirit of mutual support.</p>

This group of people will use our website to try to create other websites with different purposes (brand websites, sales websites, education websites, etc.). After using the product, they will be asked to fill out a form to answer the following questions:
                <li>Is the website easy to use and convenient?</li>
                <li>Do you have any difficulty using the website? (Example: No desired template, not enough features, etc)</li>

            <p>After receiving feedback from users, we will change and improve the website. Once the site is at its most complete, we'll put it in beta. With the first 20 people using the site, they will be asked to test and give feedback, these users will receive a website with the full domain name as a thank you for their contributions.</p>
            <p>
                Once all the above steps have been completed, we will finalize the website and put it live. Of course, in the future when the website has been put into operation, we will still receive feedback from users and continuously update the website to become the most complete.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>When working as a group, there are still some hurdles engendering self-deprecating and dissenting points of view.</li>
                <p>Solutions: Sometimes, our members have different viewpoints, so we have to group up to listen and consider every opinion carefully, one by one. As a result, everyone can hear others' opinions and choose the best one.</p>
                <li>When the project is gradually being completed, some team members started to think they do too much work while others did little than them. Therefore, little thought leads to conflict in the team.</li>
                <p>Solutions: We believe that the only solution to this problem is we have to make it clear who's going to do what and take responsibility in each section before starting this project. Moreover, if anyone has completed their section, they can also support other teammates if they want.</p>
                <li>Lack of liability: sometimes some individuals forget their assigned tasks because of their personal work.</li>
                <p>Solutions: Instead of reprimanding creating a tense atmosphere, remind the member tactfully. Let them know that because of their lack of accountability, the overall results of the group are significantly affected.</p>
                <li>Miss communication: Throughout the working process, some members will do their part alone without the approval of others. Therefore, the project will not be completed and the parts of the article will not connect with each other, which kills productivity. Moreover, miss communication can also lead to conflict and misunderstanding in the team.</li>
                <p>Solutions: This problem will easily be fixed with every person's responsibility, and always take time to understand what their teammates were saying, do not assume personal perception on anyone writing. In addition, encourage members to hand out the solution or suggest the part where there are problems or mistakes.</p>
